# Particles In A Box


This is a WebGL implementation of a particle system inside a box. Includes a standard GUI that gives you the ability to adjust gravity,
coefficient of restitution, etc.

You can check it out [here](http://karaliasn.webpages.auth.gr/particles.html). Use the arrow keys to move the camera.
